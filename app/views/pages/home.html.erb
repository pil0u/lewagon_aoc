  <p class="paragraph"><%= link_to "Advent of Code", "https://adventofcode.com/", target: :blank, class: "link-external" %> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language you like.
  Every day, from <span class="strong">December 1st</span> to <span class="strong">December 25th</span>, a new challenge pops up with some fictional Christmas backstory ðŸŽ„

  You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.
  
  Solving any puzzle earns you points ðŸ’Ž, not only for you, but also for <span class="strong">your batch & your campus city</span> @ <span class="text-wagon-red text-shadow-red">Le Wagon</span>.</p>
  
  <p class="whitespace-pre-line text-center">
