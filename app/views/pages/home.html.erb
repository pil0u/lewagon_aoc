  Every day, from <span class="text-white text-shadow-white">December 1st</span> to <span class="text-white text-shadow-white">December 25th</span>, a new challenge pops up with some fictional Christmas backstory ðŸŽ„

  You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far.
  
  Solving any puzzle earns you points ðŸ’Ž, not only for you, but also for <span class="text-white text-shadow-white">your batch & your campus city</span class=""> @ <span class="text-wagon-red text-shadow-red">Le Wagon</span>.</p>
  
  <p class="text-center whitespace-pre-line">
    Which Alumni batch is the strongest?
    Which city has crafted the best talents?

    <em>There can be only one</em>.
