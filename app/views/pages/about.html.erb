      <p class="mt-8 paragraph" data-qa-target="answer"><%= link_to "Advent of Code", "https://adventofcode.com/", target: :blank, class: "link-external" %> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.
      Every day at midnight EST/UTC-5, from <span class="strong">December 1st</span> to <span class="strong">December 25th</span>, a new challenge pops up with some fictional Christmas backstory üéÑ

      Solving any puzzle earns you points üíé, not only for you, but also for <span class="strong">your batch & your campus city</span> @ <span class="text-wagon-red text-shadow-red">Le Wagon</span>.</p>

      <li data-action="click->qa#toggle" class="py-2 text-center strong cursor-pointer select-none">What does a puzzle look like?</li>
      <p class="mt-8 paragraph" data-qa-target="answer">A puzzle is a problem defined in plain English terms, for which the answer can only be found using programming. For a given <span class="strong">input</span>, you need to compute the corresponding <span class="strong">output</span>, usually a number.

      <span class="strong">A puzzle is made of two parts</span>: you access the second one only if you solved the first one.

      If you want to take a closer look, puzzles from previous editions are available <%= link_to "here", "https://adventofcode.com/events", target: :blank, class: "link-external" %>.</p>

      <li data-action="click->qa#toggle" class="py-2 text-center strong cursor-pointer select-none">I'm not sure about my coding skills...</li>
      <p class="mt-8 paragraph" data-qa-target="answer">The difficulty of a puzzle varies from day to day. The first part of each puzzle is <span class="strong">largely accessible to a Wagoner, student or Alumni</span>. The second part is usually harder, but still accessible to more or less experienced profiles.

      Although the author of the puzzles attempts to <span class="strong">increase the difficulty over time, in reality it's not the case and pretty random</span>. You may find puzzle #20 much easier than #5. The notion of difficulty is very relative to your personal skill set and past experience with problem solving in general.

      If you get stuck on a puzzle, talk about it! This event with <span class="text-wagon-red text-shadow-red">Le Wagon</span> is, above all, an occasion <span class="strong">for sharing, learning and helping each other, regardless of your initial skill level</span>. It's also a perfect moment to reconnect with your cohort ü§ô

      <li data-action="click->qa#toggle" class="py-2 text-center strong cursor-pointer select-none">Why are there two different platforms?</li>
      <p class="mt-8 paragraph" data-qa-target="answer">The Advent of Code platform is where you find and solve the puzzles.

      Because @ <span class="text-wagon-red text-shadow-red">Le Wagon</span> we like things spicy, we wanted to build a scoreboard <span class="strong">by batch number and by city ‚öîÔ∏è</span>
      The leaderboard system on adventofcode.com is not flexible enough for that. We built this platform to create a link between Kitt and Advent of Code, so we can build <%= link_to "custom agregated scoreboards", scoreboard_path, class: "link" %>.</p>
