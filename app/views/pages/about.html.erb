      <p class="mt-8 paragraph" data-qa-target="answer"><%= link_to "Advent of Code", "https://adventofcode.com/", target: :blank, class: "link-external" %> is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.
      Every day at midnight EST/UTC-5, from <span class="strong">December 1st</span> to <span class="strong">December 25th</span>, a new puzzle pops up with some fictional Christmas backstory üéÑ

      Solving any puzzle earns you points üíé, not only for you, but also for <span class="strong">your batch & your campus city</span> @ <span class="text-wagon-red text-shadow-red">Le Wagon</span>.</p>

      <p class="mt-8 paragraph" data-qa-target="answer">A puzzle is a problem defined in plain English terms, for which the answer can only be found using programming. For a given <span class="strong">input</span>, you need to compute the corresponding <span class="strong">output</span>, usually a number.

      <span class="strong">A puzzle is made of two parts</span>: you access the second one only if you solved the first one.

      If you want to take a closer look, puzzles from previous editions are available <%= link_to "here", "https://adventofcode.com/events", target: :blank, class: "link-external" %>.</p>

      <p class="mt-8 paragraph" data-qa-target="answer">The difficulty of a puzzle varies from day to day. The first part of each puzzle is <span class="strong">largely accessible to a Wagoner, student or Alumni</span>. The second part is usually harder, but still accessible to more or less experienced profiles.

      Although the author of the puzzles attempts to <span class="strong">increase the difficulty over time, in reality it's not the case and pretty random</span>. You may find puzzle #20 much easier than #5. The notion of difficulty is very relative to your personal skill set and past experience with problem solving in general.

      If you get stuck on a puzzle, talk about it! This event with <span class="text-wagon-red text-shadow-red">Le Wagon</span> is, above all, an occasion <span class="strong">for sharing, learning and helping each other, regardless of your initial skill level</span>. It's also a perfect moment to reconnect with your cohort ü§ô

      The leaderboard system on adventofcode.com is not flexible enough for that. We built this platform to create a link between Kitt and Advent of Code, so we can build <%= link_to "custom agregated scoreboards", scoreboard_path, class: "link" %>.</p>

      <span class="underline">Individual scores</span>
      Let <code>N</code> be the number of total participants in the contest.
      For each <em>challenge</em> (out of a total of <code>50 = 25 days * 2 challenges per day</code>), participants are ranked by their time to complete it.

      The first participant to find the correct answer to a puzzle wins <code>N</code> points, the second wins one <code>N-1</code> points, the third one <code>N-2</code> points and so on. Example:

      <table class="w-full">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>User ID</th>
            <th>Day</th>
            <th>Challenge</th>
            <th>Time to complete</th>
            <th>Score</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="text-center text-xl">
          <% @ranking_example.each do |user| %>
            <tr>
              <td><%= user[:user_id] %></td>
              <td><%= user[:day] %></td>
              <td><%= user[:challenge] %></td>
              <td class="text-sm"><%= user[:time] %></td>
              <td><%= user[:score] %></td>
            </tr>
          <% end %>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      This system has two major consequences:
      <span class="ml-4"></span> 1. Even if you solve a puzzle 3 days after it's released, <span class="strong">you always earn points</span> üí∞</span>
      <span class="ml-4">2. Scores are dynamically adjusted: if you were the first to complete a challenge when there were 5 participants, the ranking showed 5 points at the time of completion. If there are now 12 participants, you have 12 points for this challenge and <span class="strong">all rankings are adjusted accordingly</span>:</span>

      <table class="w-full">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>User ID</th>
            <th>Day</th>
            <th>Challenge</th>
            <th>Time to complete</th>
            <th>Score</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="text-center text-xl">
          <% @ranking_example_updated.each do |user| %>
            <tr>
              <td><%= user[:user_id] %></td>
              <td><%= user[:day] %></td>
              <td><%= user[:challenge] %></td>
              <td class="text-sm"><%= user[:time] %></td>
              <td class="strong"><%= user[:score] %></td>
            </tr>
          <% end %>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      Your total score is the sum of the scores for all challenges.

      <span class="underline">City and batch scores</span>
      For each challenge, your city score is the sum of the individual scores from the <span class="strong">top contributors of your city</span>.

      The number of top contributors taken into accounts is determined by <span class="strong">the median number of participants in cities</span>. Example:
      <code>3</code> participants play for Amsterdam
      <code>7</code> participants play for Lisbon
      <code>21</code> participants play for London
      <code>10</code> participants play for Montreal
      <code>8</code> participants play for Rio de Janeiro
      <span class="group"><code>125</code> participants play for Paris<em class="hidden group-hover:inline absolute ml-3 w-max">cheaters!</em></span>

      The median of <code>[3, 7, 21, 10, 8, 125]</code> is <code class="strong">9</code>, so the <span class="strong">top 9 contributors of your city</span> will contribute to your city score.

      Again, this is valid <span class="strong">for each challenge</span>, so you might be the 15<sup>th</sup> for challenge A, but 7<sup>th</sup> for challenge B, so you <em>will</em> contribute to your city score with challenge B.

      Also note that the median will progressively increase (and converge) as new participants enter the competition. This means that if you are the 10<sup>th</sup> person to solve challenge C in your city, your points will be added to your city as soon as the median moves to <code class="strong">10</code>.

      Batch scores work the same, except that there is a minimum number of contributors used for calculations: <code class="strong"><%= Batch::MINIMUM_CONTRIBUTORS %></code>.

      Scores will be very dynamic as new players enter the competition, <span class="strong">don't worry too much about them</span> because the bottom line is to solve the problems as soon as possible. A good coordination within your city / your batch is <em>probably</em> a success factor in the long run.
