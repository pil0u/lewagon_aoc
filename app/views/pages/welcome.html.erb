    is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language you like.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every day, from <span class="strong">December 1st</span> to <span class="strong">December 25th</span>, a new
    programming challenge is released, wrapped into a fictional Christmas backstory ðŸŽ„
  </p>

  <p>
    You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem
    solving skills will get you pretty far.
  </p>

  <p>
    Solving any puzzle, <em>at any time</em>, earns you points ðŸ’Ž. Not only for you, but also for
    <span class="strong">your campus</span> from <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> or your dream
    <span class="strong">squad of 4 players</span>.
