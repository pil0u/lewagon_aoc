        <%= link_to "Advent of Code", "https://adventofcode.com/", target: :ext, class: "link-explicit link-external" %>
        is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day at midnight EST/UTC-5, from <span class="strong">December 1st</span> to <span class="strong">December 25th</span>,
        a new puzzle pops up with some fictional Christmas backstory üéÑ
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving any puzzle earns you points üíé, not only for you, but also for <span class="strong">your campus city</span>
        @ <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> and your custom <span class="strong">squad of 4</span>.

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-y-2 text-justify">
      <p>
        A puzzle is a problem defined in plain English terms, for which the answer can only be found using programming. For a given
        <span class="strong">input</span>, you need to compute the corresponding <span class="strong">output</span>, usually a number.
      </p>
      <p>A puzzle is made of two parts, two <em>challenges</em>: you access the second one only <span class="strong">if you solved the first one</span>.</p>
      <p>
        If you want to take a closer look, puzzles from previous editions are available
        <%= link_to "here", "https://adventofcode.com/events", target: :ext, class: "link-explicit link-external" %>.

      <p>
        The difficulty of a puzzle varies from day to day. The first part of each puzzle is <span class="strong">largely accessible to a Wagoner, student or Alumni</span>.
        The second part is usually harder, but still accessible to more or less experienced profiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the author of the puzzles attempts to <span class="strong">increase the difficulty over time, in reality it's not the case and pretty random</span>.
        You may find puzzle #20 much easier than #5. The notion of difficulty is very relative to your personal skill set and past experience with problem solving in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get stuck on a puzzle, talk about it! This event with <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> is, above all, a great opportunity
        <span class="strong">for sharing, learning and helping each other, regardless of your initial skill level</span>. It's also a perfect moment to reconnect with your city/batch ü§ô

      <p>The Advent of Code platform is where you find and solve the puzzles.</p>
      <p>
        Because @ <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> we like things spicy, we wanted to build scoreboards <span class="strong">by campus city ‚öîÔ∏è</span>
        The leaderboard system on adventofcode.com is not flexible enough for that. We built this platform to create a link between Kitt and Advent of Code,
        so we can build <%= link_to "custom agregated scoreboards", scores_path, class: "link-explicit link-internal" %>.</p>
