  <p>
    <span class="text-wagon-red">Le Wagon</span> x <span class="text-other-green">Advent of Code</span> is about
    learning, collaboration, sharing and having fun. It is a breeze of warmth of intellectual stimulation and kindness
    as we approach Christmas.
  </p>

  <p>
    During an event about fun, rules are boring, but boring people breaking rules is not fun.
  </p>

  <p class="strong">
    All participants of the event are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct.
  </p>

  <ol class="list-decimal flex flex-col max-w-2xl mx-auto gap-y-4">
    <li>
      <h3 class="strong">Be respectful and empathetic towards all community members</h3>
      <p>
        This event and the
        <%= link_to "#aoc Slack channel", Aoc.slack_channel, target: :_blank, rel: :noopener, class: "link-explicit link-slack" %>
        should be a safe place for everyone. Always assume positive intent, be positive, friendly and helpful to
        others. Focus on good vibes; we do not tolerate any form of derogatory comments or personal attacks.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 class="strong">Avoid sharing direct solutions or spoilers</h3>
      <p>
        It ruins the fun. There are dedicated places for that:<br>
        1. the platform has a solution sharing feature<br>
        2. the community usually opens two threads in the
        <%= link_to "#aoc Slack channel", Aoc.slack_channel, class: "link-explicit link-slack" %>: one to discuss the
        puzzles <em>without spoilers</em> - only hints and guidance - and another one <em>with spoilers</em>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 class="strong">Respect the competitive aspects of the event</h3>
      <p>
        Just like during the bootcamp, we do allow and even encourage participants to solve puzzles in groups. Just like
        during the bootcamp, brainlessly copy-pasting solutions hampers the learning process and is not fair to others,
        thus forbidden.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 class="strong">Please, don't try to break in</h3>
      <p>
        Attempting to access the platform in unauthorized ways is not permitted and is not fun for the community or the
        Admins. The platform's code is
        <%= link_to "open", "https://github.com/pil0u/lewagon-aoc/", target: :_blank, rel: :noopener, class: "link-explicit link-external" %>
        and all the data you can find here is available upon request. Also, scores are computed from AoC's data, so they
        cannot be changed by breaking in <em>here</em> anyway.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3 class="strong">Anything can happen</h3>
      <p>
        As organisers, we anticipate most issues, but surprises may happen. We reserve the right to update this Code of
        Conduct as needed. Any changes will be communicated to participants.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="strong">Enforcement</h3>

  <p>
    Violation of these rules may be reported to the Admins via private Slack messages. All reports will be reviewed and
    investigated. We will take appropriate actions, ranging from a warning to an exclusion from the event, depending on
    the severity of the violation.
